Actually, I think I do have theory for what is happening. I think there
is some kind of exception happening in one of your recipes which is
perhaps causing it to be skipped/ignored and this is corrupting the
state of the parser.

I'm guessing the classes variable in BBConfHandler.py isn't getting
reset to [None, ] and hence the next recipe to be parsed sees "oddness"
due to the field not being reset.

This would happen in the classes.remove(__classname__) line never get
called, which would happen if statements.eval(d) or some other part of
the processing failed.

I would add some debug code into gitpkgv.bbclass around the functions
there, perhaps a try:/except: and see if there is some kind of uncaught
exception happening for one of your recipes. If that isn't it, I would
be intersted to understand what you have which is breaking out the
fetcher. It could be a SkipPackage exception under some circumstance for
example.

This would explain the cause, we then need to fix the parser state
engine so its properly reset each time...

Cheers,

Richard
