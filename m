FWIW I did try and discuss this in the OE TSC meeting today but it is a
US holiday. There were only two people who showed up.

One of the challenges is the "patch" code/module lives in OE-Core. That
means the fetcher can't call into it.

I appreciate this means you'll argue the fetcher code should move to
OE, or the vendor code should be in OE, however I am pretty decided
that is a really bad idea. Whether I can convey why, I don't know but I
have tried.

I also very strongly want to maintain our separation of do_fetch,
do_unpack and do_patch.

A patch was merged to allow the data about implicit git repos (amongst
other things) to be available:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/bitbake/?id=3Def3e46afd910d4b7727d=
42c4c18b501525c65695

That tracer code was added after a lot of discussion that took up a ton
of my time, then people moved on and it hasn't seem much
development/use :(.

So there were mechanisms added to make the data available.

I believe there was a way added to solve the drawback you mention. The
same mechanism could be used for other fetchers too yet we're talking
about much more radical re-designs.

The "fetcher" is an API exposed by Bitbake with the intent of
standardising the fetching of source code. It's aim is to support
objectives such as allowing resilience through source mirrors and
support build reproducibility. There is a document in bitbake which
tries to at least summarise some of that after it was requested it be
written down.

These were the original fetchers using the original APIs.

These are newer and some work better than others are people have
attempted to git the newer languages into the older framework.

Of these, gitsm is now relatively successfully integrated and
functional.

Sadly there did not seem to be any other way to handle that. I'd
imagine that some of the other fetchers are going to have to work
similarly, unfortunately.

We support pypi in so much as we have a recipe per dependency. That was
not deemed possible for npm or crates. I would disagree that uncommon
URIS are useless for SBOMs. They can be problematic but having the data
there means it is at least listed. There are also ways they can be
extended (e.g. the intercept code I link to above).

> Is PyPI or crate the desired way to go?

Compared to the complexity in some of the patches proposed, I'd
actually say yes.

The challenge is that once you process it, you need to fetch more
things. Our ecosystem is built on the idea that fetching happens in
do_fetch. If we change that most mirroring scripts break for example.
It is like compiling happening during do_configure or do_install - it
is not what the user expects and that is problematic. I am against
changing behaviour in ways users do not expect.

This is the case for good reason. If the lock file references all the
sources, perhaps we should just include it alongside the recipe and be
done with it?

I think we may have to relax some of these requirements as we can't do
everything.

Ironically, I think this an example of the kind of "strong API" I'm
referring to, where a standard API is exposed by bitbake. In some ways
this was already attempted with the tracer API above where the
expand_urldata call would actually be a call into the tracer API to
obtain the actual urls used.

I believe the get_src_uris() functionality should happen within the
fetcher module and not outside of it as a bolt on interface.

I do not know where we go from here. You disagree with me on several
key things such as whether the code should be in bitbake or OE-Core,
whether gitsm should be changed, whether we need to have some kind of
checksum to verify the "lockfile" is correct as originally intended in
the recipe and probably more.

I'm in the position of trying to mediate things (i.e. see the different
viewpoints and bring people together, trying to find common ground) and
yet at the same time, express views as someone who as spent a lot of
years trying to maintain and improve this code.

I have tried to seek help from the people who effectively oversee me as
a maintainer (i.e. the TSC) with limited success. I'm not sure what to
do from here.
