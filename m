Therefore we need to fix the mirror regex. Otherwise we have to mimic 
the upstream layout in the download directory.

Do you mean a Cargo.lock, go.sum and package-lock.json file or a 
proprietary file?

We could save the generated SRC_URIs and a hash of the lock file in a 
file in the download directory. The file could be used for inspection 
and as cache to avoid a regeneration.

Go, Rust and NPM already resolve the recursive dependencies in its lock 
file. Only gitsm need to resolve the recursive dependencies.

We have the fetcher.expanded_urldata function to receive the expanded 
SRC_URI list. Maybe we could make it easy accessible.

> the reproducibility
The generated SRC_URIs only depends on the lock file and some variables. 
We could reduce the variables if we depend on the PREMIRROR to configure 
a local proxy or registry.

My last implementation are based on the wget and git fetcher. The 
mirroring will work as soon as we fix it.

I would focus on patch files for the lock file. It is always possible to 
remove the SRC_URI line and replace it with the desired dependency list. 
The list could be extracted from the cache file in the download 
directory or could be received via the expanded_urldata function. The 
function already returns the git

            pulled this to a separate email/thread since I'd like to
            take a<br>
            slight step back and put some different ideas into the mix
            as well as<br>
            explain where my own thoughts are right now. I'm also doing
            this so<br>
            that we can focus the discussion and give others a place to
            catch up<br>
            from. For that reason I may restate some information below.<br>
            <br>
            We have two fundamentally different approaches:<br>
            <br>
            a) a single entry in SRC_URI with magic behind the scenes
            expanding<br>
            this into a list of dependencies<br>
            <br>
            b) multiple entries in SRC_URI generated with tooling<br>
            <br>
            gitsm is similar to a), partly because it can contain
            recursive<br>
            references to other submodules so the second approach
            wouldn't work.<br>
            crates are handled with the b) approach today.<br>
            <br>
            Developers in general are more comfortable with b) since
            they can more<br>
            easily see what is going on but it is also the harder one
            since it<br>
            deviates most from the underlying tools and has two sets of
            data that<br>
            require to be in sync.<br>
            <br>
            Some feel the .inc files enabling b) are effectively machine
            generated<br>
            and could be removed with the work happening transparently
            instead,<br>
            simplifying the recipes and commits. This allows easier use
            of the<br>
            underlying tooling too.<br>
            <br>
            I think firstly, we need to document some key principles.
            Behind the<br>
            scenes, any given url should expand to a defined list of
            components and<br>
            that list has to be deterministic and not &quot;floating&quot;, i.e.
            always the<br>
            same regardless of changes in any registry or other
            upstream. If there<br>
            are changes, they need to be detected and there needs to be
            a hard<br>
            error. Also, if the code sees things declared in a way they
            could vary,<br>
            that also needs to be a hard error.<br>

    Therefore we need to fix the mirror regex. Otherwise we have to

    Do you mean a Cargo.lock, go.sum and package-lock.json file or a

    <br>
    We could save the generated SRC_URIs and a hash of the lock file in

    The generated SRC_URIs only depends on the lock file and some
