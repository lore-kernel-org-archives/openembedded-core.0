with layers we dont control policies of all the layers that may be used on top
so fixing meta-oe does not solve problem completely and we can not ask
for exclusive
recipes. People would want to override the recipes from other layers.

bitbake could report the layer the recipe comes from which can make it evident
or may be special command to inform the layer priorities. This will guide the
users to diagnose the problems quickly and help developers to identify
the issues
faster. There could be a complete bill of recipes printed for a given
target as well
so if someone wants to check all the recipes that were built.

In any case I agree that problems should be fixed. However this does
not scale to all
layers and we can not police all the layers and we should not. We
should try to make it possible
for people to glue layers together without  issues.
