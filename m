I had a look around, and I think it should be quite feasible to
implement a reference server using only the standard Python libraries
(e.g. SimpleHTTPServer). The actual API that the server is *required*
to implement is very small (a single endpoint of "/v1/equivalent" with
GET and POST methods). It will probably have a number of limitations
(scalability, authentication, security, etc.) but for something to get
started or for automated testing purposes, I think it will be
sufficient.

I'll probably wait a few days at least before I loop back around to
look at that, so I'd like to leave this discussion open, e.g. Do we
want a simpler reference implementation?
