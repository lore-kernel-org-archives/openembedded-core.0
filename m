Hello everyone,

We are currently working on the fourth edition of our Yocto Project book
and have been updating the content from Yocto Project 4.0 to the upcoming
6.0 release. As part of this effort, we have been working extensively with
the new bitbake-setup tool and its documentation.

First, we would like to say that bitbake-setup is a welcome addition to the
ecosystem. The move from the monolithic Poky repository approach to a more
modular, template-based setup is a significant improvement for flexibility
and reproducibility.

During our work, we identified some areas where we believe the
documentation and tooling could be improved to make the experience smoother
for newcomers. We are sharing these observations in the hope of starting a
constructive conversation.
Terminology Suggestions

The current documentation introduces several new terms that we found
challenging to communicate clearly to readers. We would like to propose
some alternative naming that we believe would be more intuitive.
1. Generic Configuration =E2=86=92 BitBake Setup Template

The term "Generic Configuration" does not immediately convey that this is a
reusable template file used as input to create a build environment. The
word "generic" can be interpreted as "basic" or "non-specialized" rather
than "reusable template."

We suggest *BitBake Setup Template* as an alternative. This clearly
communicates that the .conf.json file serves as a template for creating
setups.
2. Specific Configuration =E2=86=92 BitBake Setup Instance

Similarly, "Specific Configuration" does not clearly indicate that this is
the *result* of applying a template with user choices. The relationship
between "Generic" and "Specific" is not immediately obvious.

We suggest *BitBake Setup Instance* as an alternative. The "Template =E2=86=
=92
Instance" pattern is widely understood by developers and immediately
conveys the relationship: a template is used to create an instance.
3. Nested "configurations" =E2=86=92 Variant

Within a BitBake Setup Template, there are nested "configurations" (e.g.,
poky, poky-with-sstate) that represent predefined bundles of fragments and
settings. Using "configuration" here creates confusion since the term is
already heavily overloaded in the Yocto ecosystem.

We suggest *Variant* as an alternative. This conveys that these are
different flavors or variations of the same base template, similar to how
distributions have variants or flavors.
Summary Table
Current Term Proposed Term
Generic Configuration BitBake Setup Template
Specific Configuration BitBake Setup Instance
(nested) configurations Variant
Tooling and Usability Feedback 1. pip-installed bitbake-setup Cannot Access
Default Registries

When installing bitbake-setup via pip and running bitbake-setup init, the
command fails because it cannot locate the default registry files that
would normally be at ./bitbake/default-registry/.

This creates a confusing first experience for users who expect a
pip-installed tool to work out of the box. Having to clone the full BitBake
repository defeats the convenience of pip installation.
2. Allow Empty Variants in Templates

Currently, bitbake-setup init requires the user to select a variant when
one is defined in the template. There is no option to skip this selection.

Allowing templates without variants (or making variant selection optional)
would reduce the number of questions during setup, making the process
faster and more approachable for newcomers.
3. Unclear Error When Using Non-Raw URLs

When running bitbake-setup init with a URL to a .conf.json file hosted on
platforms like GitHub or GitLab, users naturally copy the URL from their
browser. This URL points to an HTML page rather than the raw JSON content,
causing the command to fail.

The error message does not clearly indicate that a raw/plain URL is
required. A clearer error message or guidance would help users understand
the issue more quickly.
4. Tool to Generate Templates from Existing Environments

Currently, there is no way to generate a BitBake Setup Template from:

   - An existing BitBake Setup Instance
   - A traditional workspace set up manually with oe-init-build-env
   - Any working Yocto/OpenEmbedded build environment

A tool to export a working environment as a template would:

   - Help users migrate existing projects to the new bitbake-setup workflow
   - Make it easier to share working configurations with colleagues or the
   community
   - Reduce the barrier to adoption for users with established projects

5. Fragment Discovery on OpenEmbedded Layer Index

The OpenEmbedded Layer Index (https://layers.openembedded.org) is an
excellent resource for discovering layers. However, there is no equivalent
discovery mechanism for configuration fragments.

Adding a tab or section for fragments would help users discover available
fragments and understand what problems they solve.
------------------------------

We hope this feedback is helpful. We are happy to discuss any of these
points further or assist with documentation improvements.

Best regards,

Ot=C3=A1vio Salvador
