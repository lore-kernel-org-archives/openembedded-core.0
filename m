There have been API changes in upstream which mean this code will fail
to work with bitbake itself although it will work with the pr server.

I've merged the patches as a bandaid to allow things to work but we've
now got two different server backends using different server APIs. I
really just want to highlight I'm aware of this and it will get
addressed next week. Its been on my todo list and is way overdue. The
main priority is to get people's builds with OE-Core working again.

Cheers,

Richard
