This question should go to the "openembedded-core@lists.openembedded.org"
mailing list, or a list specific to the layers.  (I have CC'd this list.)

Unfortunately I am not surprised by this.  Daisy is quite old at this point.  It
was released in April of 2014.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 was not released until January
2015.  I doubt that the system, nor python 2.7.3 (as integrated) has any idea
that version 1.0.2 exists.

You will likely need to look at backporting support from a newer version of
python to support the 1.0.2 API.
