The fetch task is the only task allowed to access the network and is
the only place where the sources should be being downloaded. Once the
do_fetch task completes, we have everything we need from the network
and no further network access is allowed.

So yes, your assumption is therefore wrong. I'm focusing on this as if
we don't have that common understanding, nothing built upon those
different understandings is going to work.

It would not be okay at all, no.=C2=A0

I appreciate theoretical discussion is hard work but we've tried taking
patches in the past and we've ended up making things worse. I can tell
the direction you've been going isn't correct and is going to lead to
patches which are unable to be merged.

I've made it very very clear that the fetch module stays in bitbake and
that we need to find a way to support this in the fetch module, not OE.
Yes, that complicates things unfortunately but I have good reasons for
doing it, whether you understand or agree with them or not. I'm not
changing my mind on this.

I will say your original patch series against bitbake was probably a
lot closer to what I think we probably need. I didn't like the "magic"
going on to extend the data so perhaps if that piece were reworked and
made a more default/simpler/clearer part of the fetcher rather than
hidden, we'd probably reach some code we could agree on.

Cheers,

Richard
