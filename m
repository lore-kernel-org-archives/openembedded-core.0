 I have created branches for both Gatesgarth and Dunfell in openembedded-co=
re-contrib and meta-openembedded-contrib with the required patches. The bra=
nches are called pkj/_PYTHON_SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME-gatesgarth and pkj/_PYTHON_=
SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME-dunfell (ok, horrible names, but they should be easy to =
spot). There is one additional patch for bitbake, but I forgot to ask for a=
ccess to bitbake-contrib, so you will have to cherry-pick it from commit 47=
b64cfa (it is not strictly necessary as it is just clean up made possible a=
fter the changes in OE-Core).

I did an autobuilder run with your meta-openembedded branch, my
stable/dunfell-nut branch with the 6 patches, and my bitbake
stable/1.46-nut branch with the single patch:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/88/builds/921

All was fine except for an error in sysdig: do_compile, which doesn't
appear to be related:

https://errors.yoctoproject.org/Errors/Details/570303/

Unless someone has an objection I'll add the oe-core and bitbake
patches to my next set of review patches.
