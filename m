Hi Alex,

We are not though=2E We are integrating an established tool for multi-repo=
sitory management into yocto=2E Google repo is not proprietary by the way, =
it is permissive licensed=2E It is just a little "special" in it's modus op=
erandi=2E

But that is exactly what we are doing, by integrating the repo fetcher int=
o the yocto workflow, thus improving the yocto tooling :)
Why reinvent the wheel, when you can reuse whats already there? You wouldn=
't reinvent git just for yocto, would you?

Best regards,
Jasper
