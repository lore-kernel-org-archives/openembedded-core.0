I may have missed that in the patches, but if that isn't described in the
commit logs, then
that description would be a nice addition. Along with a high level
description for each
supported language package manager about what is in the files and what uses
it to
resolve the dependencies.

The issue with patching those dynamic files .. is just that, they are
dynamic and
they could be regenerated (but hopefully without a SRCREV change they are
identically
generated each time, so maybe it isn't a big deal) and patching could fail.
Much like we
don't patch generated automake files, we patch the .am and .in files that
generate the
outputs.

ok. So they are really just a way to dump what is being built to disk and
out of "memory",
it really isn't what I was looking for, but at least I understand what you
were trying to
do with the writing and later use of the files now.

I was hoping for something that I could include "statically" (for lack of a
better term) in my
recipes, and then have the handlers for the protocols do the fetching ..
again, much like
the crate:// fetches in the .inc files.

To be clear, I'm not suggesting that mode would be the only mode, just that
the way the
generation of the fetches -> actual fetching was constructed such that I
could avoid
"short circuit" the handling of the lock file and simply list the
dependencies for fetching
(much like how I can go get all of the SRCREVS for a gitsm:// fetch, and
put them into
my recipes as pure git:// fetches if I'm having issues with the git
submodles).

That file would manipulate the standard SRC_URI. In other words still

See above. It isn't about re-running it a later time and re-using the
artifacts, it is about
having a way to make sure nothing is dynamically resolved when bitbake
<foo> is called,
just fetch and the rest of the standard tasks.

Something like that is a big step towards having that finer grained control
in a recipe that
I'm looking for. I'd still like some sort of line by line "dumped
dependency list" if there's a
lower level protocol at play (but the lock file really also is just that
line by line list for many
of the languages).

The series adds on-the-fly support for package manager specific
dependencies and vendor directories. It contains the following changes:
1. Adds an early fetch, unpack and patch task to unpack and patch source
   code with an embedded lock file for dependencies.
2. Parse the go.sum, Cargo.lock and package-lock.json lock files and
   resolve the dependencies to SRC_URIs.
3. Save the SRC_URIs in a file and adapt all SRC_URIs users to handle
   the SRC_URI files beside the SRC_URIs in the recipe.
