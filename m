From: Randolph Sapp <rs@ti.com>

We've recently run into some issues with weston-init attempting to start
Weston prior to all drm devices being registered. There's not really a
good, scriptable mechanism to listen in to device registration events
that works with the existing weston-init package. Well, at least one
that doesn't involve polling files or introducing more dependency on the
init system being used.

I also see there is also a lot of scripting around starting X11,
xserver-nodm-init, that (from my limited review) should experience the
same issue.

I'd like to introduce the following display manager for oe-core, emptty
[1]. This display manager is, as described upstream, a "Dead simple CLI
Display Manager on TTY". It supports both x11 and wayland sessions, with
togglable build parameters to completely remove x11 and pam
dependencies. It's licensed MIT, which shouldn't be an issue for any
users. (It is written in Go, if you have opinions about that.)

With this, both weston-init and the xserver-nodm-init packages can be
re-tuned to leverage this display manager and simply add a user and
emptty config for an autologin session. This can resolve the current
behavior across init systems without additional scripting, and move some
development out of this layer.

This lists myself as a maintainer of emptty as well as xserver-nodm-init and
xuser-account since these are currently unassigned and I've reworked them
significantly here.

Sorry for the delay on this series. I found a few bugs in emptty that I wanted
to address before submitting this officially.

[1] https://github.com/tvrzna/emptty

v2:
	- Address spelling issues in commit messages
	- Attempt to resolve some test related issues with weston
	- Add additional logs to X11 related tests
v3:
	- Reset AUTOLOGIN_MAX_RETRY to the default value of 2. When running
	  under QEMU the first auth attempt almost always fails.
v4:
	- Add a tmpfile entry for the x11 domain socket directory.
	- Remove some scripts associated with weston-init that were being
	  shipped with weston

Randolph Sapp (5):
  libx11: create tmpfile dir for x11 domain socket
  emptty: add version 0.14.0
  weston-init: convert to virtual-emptty-conf
  weston: remove deprecated weston-start scripts
  xserver-nodm-init: convert to virtual-emptty-conf
