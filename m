Yes, yocto does not support 'variations' of the build that is already set
up. Once you set the distro, and the machine, there's only one way to build
a recipe; if you want another way, you need to indeed make another recipe,
or another distro. I would still say making a set of distros is still the
proper 'yocto way' to solve your problem. There are examples in meta-poky:
poky-altcfg and poky-tiny, and there has been poky-bleeding-revisions or
similar in the past.

This is a reoccurring topic; there have been proposal in the past to
introduce 'variants' as yet another abstraction, but they add so much
complexity on top of what is already very complex, that the tradeoff is not
acceptable to the project.
