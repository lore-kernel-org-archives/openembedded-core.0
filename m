Ah, I didn't realize there was desire to have it actually be part of
bitbake... That would change the strategy considerably.

I think that is a worth while discussion to have. I obviously wasn't
thinking the server would be part of bitbake, I was more thinking it
would probably be an independent project (I even have a name picked out
already ;), so I'm curious what thoughts there are on the advantages
and disadvantages of doing that.

Sure. Pipenv makes it pretty easy to pull in a lot of shiny modules
that you don't necessarily need, and I may have gone a little
overboard. I do have some justification for *most* of the things I
brought in besides just "it looked cool". We can dig into them deeper.

However, pipenv (or python virtual environments) are designed to amke
these types of decisions easier, so I think that the discussion about
what dependencies we do or don't want should probably start there (i.e.
do we allow pipenv or not?). Basically, it's much easier to pull in the
dependencies you need (and even fix versions for production use) with
pipenv. This of course doesn't mean you can be careless about what you
pull in, but it makes you a lot more independent from the host setup.

Oh right! Pipenv defaults to the version of Python you have installed.
I'm pretty sure you can relax the restriction to just "python 3", but I
forgot to do so before I pushed the patch.

I think perhaps my use of the term "reference implementation" was too
strong. "Example implementation for testing", or "toy implementation"
might be more inline with my intention.
