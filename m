Hello,

this email is a notification from the Auto Upgrade Helper
that the automatic attempt to upgrade the recipe *x264* to *cde9a93319bea766a92e306d69059c76de970190* has Succeeded.

Next steps:
    - apply the patch: git am 0001-x264-upgrade-to-latest-revision.patch
    - check the changes to upstream patches and summarize them in the commit message,
    - compile an image that contains the package
    - perform some basic sanity tests
    - amend the patch and sign it off: git commit -s --reset-author --amend
    - send it to the appropriate mailing list

Alternatively, if you believe the recipe should not be upgraded at this time,
you can fill RECIPE_NO_UPDATE_REASON in respective recipe file so that
automatic upgrades would no longer be attempted.

Please review the attached files for further information and build/update failures.
Any problem please file a bug at https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Automated%20Update%20Handler
