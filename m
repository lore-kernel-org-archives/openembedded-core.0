I have taken a look at the code, and there two places that I have found so
far that contain the RPROVIDES_* for each package. One is the taskdata at
the bitbake level, and the other is the pkgdata directory within the
sysroot for the machine's build. The taskdata seems more readily accessible
in memory. However, I've neither figured out a way to access it from the
image recipe namespace, nor do I know if it's intended to be accessed at
the recipe level. On the other hand, the pkgdata directory holds
information about all built packages, and I've written some code derived
from packageinfo.bbclass (used in hob) that loads all the package
information into memory.

For the case provided in bug 6149, the code could access the
PREFERRED_PROVIDER for the missing sshd package, search the pkgdata, and
then replace 'sshd' within PACKAGE_INSTALL with 'dropbear' as specified
within RPROVIDES_dropbear = "ssh sshd".

A problem is the inefficiency of parsing through the pkgdata files. Maybe a
rewrite of IMAGE_INSTALL be done during the calculations taskdata.py
instead, or maybe the name of the package rproviding the item needs to be
saved and referred to during the image generation.
