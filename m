I started swapping over local builds to bitbake-setup this week, for a
basic qemu core-image-base it was impressively straightforward.

But I've immediately run into things where I know how to do them in
the old world, but not the right way to do them in the new[1] and
failing to find answers in the docs, which isn't to say the answers
aren't there, I've just not found them.

If there's things I could usefully help with documenting/testing, I've
got time on my hands as my current contract is on hold...

[1] how do I add a layer which hasn't been migrated to bitbake-setup
was the first I hit
