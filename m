I need to spend some time digesting this series but this patch did make
me a little sad.

I'm hoping we can make the hash equivalence server something people use
easily and perhaps part of bitbake. The dependencies you've used in
this code mean it has a significantly higher "barrier to use" than most
of our other code though :(

On the one hand I can understand people wanting to use dependencies and
new technology. On the other, keeping things simple also has
advantages.

Even the minimum python version is potentially problematic, we don't
even have working recipes for python 3.6!

I appreciate its a reference and means we can test the rest of the code
 so its good but we may need a different implementation of this
ultimately.

Cheers,

Richard
