I build images which are not based on any of the core-XXX images listed by HOB.
How can I get them into the drop-down base list?
Is there a way I can filter out some of the base images?  tasks?

I ask these questions because in particular, I use a lot of the recipes in meta
and meta-yocto, but none of the images or tasks (because they don't really address
my needs, don't take offense, I just want more control than they offer)
