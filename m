I don't get the point. Do you say that only the do_fetch is allow to 
download anything? So my assumption that I can download something 
outside the do_fetch task as long as the download happens if something 
depend on the fetch task (like bitbake -c fetch ...) is wrong?

I don't understand that requirement but I can fulfill it. The only 
consequence is a complex do_fetch task.

But this is an essential feature because it simplify the usability. It 
allows inexperienced user to fix a security issue in some minutes by 
simple back port a patch from the upstream project or fix the problem 
with common tools outside of oe.

I don't change the boundaries. The boundaries are not clean at the 
moment. Look at the code. Most users of the URIs assume that only the 
SRC_URI exists. Because of gitsm this isn't true. But only the archiver 
bbclass use it correct. The spdx classes notice it but fix it in a wrong 
way. It simple replace the gitsm:// with a git:// and lose all the 
dependent sources. I want to sharpen the concept by introduce a fetcher 
/ source library in oe. The library abstract the bitbake fetcher details 
and provide a simple api on top of it. This allows us to remove all the 
duplicated code. The bitbake fetcher focus on the download and the oe 
fetcher class on the management of the URIs. This allows use to 
introduce new concept for the URI management and allows use to remove 
the repeat instantiation and parsing of the SRC_URI.

Based on the code I would argue that the user base don't know that the 
SRC_URI could be expand to additional URIs nor that a SRC_URI is 
replaced by an other URI underneath. We have to fix this in any way and 
I would take the opportunity to introduce a simpler and feature rich 
solution.

We have a go-vendor bbclass and gomod fetcher. The first use the wget 
and git fetcher and the second add a specific fetcher. We have two 
solutions for the same problem with different concepts.

I always try my best to not break existing users. Therefore I keep the 
old behavior of the existing tasks or function calls. But we need to 
sharpen the concepts and unify the code base. We have different 
solutions (like go-vendor.bbclass and gomod.py) for the same problem and 
partial integration of features (like expanded_urldata).

I think we have to much theoretical discussion and to less code. I would 
like to integrate a Fetcher OE library to remove the redundant code, 
unify the codebase and use the extended URIs where appropriate. This 
would fix some existing problems and could help in the next step 
independence of the solution. Would that be okay with you?

          The missing point is that the expectation is related to the

      <div>I could try and reply to all your points but this one jumps
        out as a really fundamental thing we disagree on. All our
        existing code assumes that:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&quot;All sources are downloaded during do_fetch&quot;<br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>which means once do_fetch runs, we have all the sources. That
        is quite different to what you say above. I fully appreciate it
        imposes quite some constraints but it doesn't change the fact
        that this is the situation.<br>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I don't get the point. Do you say that only the do_fetch is allow
      to download anything? So my assumption that I can download
      something outside the do_fetch task as long as the download
      happens if something depend on the fetch task (like bitbake -c
      fetch ...) is wrong?<br>
      <br>
      I don't understand that requirement but I can fulfill it. The only
      consequence is a complex do_fetch task.<br>

      <div>We have a patchwork where people trust the current boundaries
        between the different pieces. You want to change the boundaries,
        and the assumptions made about those boundaries and replace it
        with something that isn't going to be easily understood by most
        of the userbase as the concepts are complex and break the
        existing models people work with. I'm doing my best to explain
        the problem but either I'm failing at that or we simply disagree
        on them.<br>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I don't change the boundaries. The boundaries are not clean at
      the moment. Look at the code. Most users of the URIs assume that
      only the SRC_URI exists. Because of gitsm this isn't true. But
      only the archiver bbclass use it correct. The spdx classes notice
      it but fix it in a wrong way. It simple replace the gitsm:// with
      a git:// and lose all the dependent sources. I want to sharpen the
      concept by introduce a fetcher / source library in oe. The library
      abstract the bitbake fetcher details and provide a simple api on
      top of it. This allows us to remove all the duplicated code. The
      bitbake fetcher focus on the download and the oe fetcher class on
      the management of the URIs. This allows use to introduce new
