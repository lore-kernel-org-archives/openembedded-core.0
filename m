I like the Template/Instance suggestion, but I'm not sure about removing th=
e
word "configuration" out of these terms. We are speaking about the
_configuration_ of a Setup after all, and "BitBake Setup Instance" could be
misinterpreted as a running bitbake-setup execution.

So maybe:

  Bitbake Setup Configuration Template
  Bitbake Setup Configuration Instance

or simply:

  Configuration Template
  Configuration Instance

Would be enough. Having "BitBake Setup" prefixing every occurrence of this =
term
is going to be too much otherwise?

What do you think?

That sounds good to me, but would you also define a Variant as its own term=
 (in
the glossary)?

I believe this is already achievable with the --skip-selection option?

Instead of no variants, maybe we just want to instruct the user to run:

  bitbake-setup init --non-interactive choice1 choice2 ...

Another idea would be to make it possible to define default choices
in an existing template? The documentation would then instruct the user to
simply execute:

  bitbake-setup init --non-interactive

which, with no choices passed on the command-line, would provide the user w=
ith
the default variant (the Poky Setup). The default choices would still have =
to be
printed on the console to make it clear to the user what was selected.

Good idea IMO, as we already have machines and distros there, fragments wou=

a nice addition.

Thanks for looking into this!
