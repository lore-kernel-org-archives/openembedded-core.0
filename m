== Summary ==


Thank you for submitting this patch series to OpenEmbedded Core. This is
an automated response. Several tests have been executed on the proposed
series by patchtest resulting in the following failures:



* Patch            [11/15] flex: update to 2.6.4
 Issue             Missing or incorrectly formatted CVE tag in included patch file [test_cve_tag_format] 
  Suggested fix    Correct or include the CVE tag on cve patch with format: "CVE: CVE-YYYY-XXXX"

* Issue             Upstream-Status is Inappropriate, but no reason was provided [test_upstream_status_presence_format] 
  Suggested fix    Include a brief reason why use-pkgconfig.patch is inappropriate
  Current          Upstream-Status: Inappropriate (upstream still refuse to consider pkg-config)
  Standard format  Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [reason]



If you believe any of these test results are incorrect, please reply to the
mailing list (openembedded-core@lists.openembedded.org) raising your concerns.
Otherwise we would appreciate you correcting the issues and submitting a new
version of the patchset if applicable. Please ensure you add/increment the
version number when sending the new version (i.e. [PATCH] -> [PATCH v2] ->
[PATCH v3] -> ...).
