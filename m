What does reproducible mean? The lock file ensure that you always use 
the same dependencies.

go.sum:
cloud.google.com/go v0.110.0 h1:Zc8gqp3+a9/Eyph2KDmcGaPtbKRIoqq4YTlL4NMD0Ys=

Cargo.lock:
[[package]]
name = "addr2line"
version = "0.24.2"
source = "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"
checksum = 
"dfbe277e56a376000877090da837660b4427aad530e3028d44e0bffe4f89a1c1"
dependencies = [
  "gimli",
]

package-lock.json:
     "node_modules/@adobe/css-tools": {
       "version": "4.3.3",
       "resolved": 
"https://registry.npmjs.org/@adobe/css-tools/-/css-tools-4.3.3.tgz",
       "integrity": 
"sha512-rE0Pygv0sEZ4vBWHlAgJLGDU7Pm8xoO6p3wsEceb7GYAjScrOHpEo8KK/eVkAcnSM+slAEtXjA2JpdjLp4fJQQ==",
       "dev": true
     },

The URL could be extracted from the lock file or could be generated 
based on the name and version or git revision. The integrity of the 
dependencies is ensured via a checksum or git revision. This means the 
same lock file always generate the same downloads and is fully 
reproducible. We only need to ensure the integrity of the lock file. 
This is already ensure by the existing fetchers.

At the moment the download URL could be manipulated by an variable 
because it is common to change the registry / proxy / server. The 
"https://registry.npmjs.org" or 
"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index" are placeholders 
and could be replaced with a local registry / proxy / server. Additional 
the downloads are unpacked into a subfolder of the project. Therefore 
the SRC_URI parameters depends on S.

I already expand the SRC_URIs with a name and version (pn and pv) to 
enrich the SBOM with the name and version of the dependencies. Because 
the name parameter is already in use and the recipe could use a 
dependency in different versions we need to append the version to the 
name. Either we remove the version from the name to receive the real 
name, use an other parameter for the name or use the name and version as 
variable flag instead of the name alone.

It is already possible to create a list of the dependencies.

This sounds like a problem with the test coverage. But this should be 
solved by a high test coverage for the resolve function.

We can extract the dependency name and version from the SRC_URIs to hash 
it but in case of npm the destination folder could also influence the build.

Can we instead extend the lock file in the download folder which the 
SRC_URIs? This allows use to use the file as cache and bypass the resolve.

Is it okay to use variables like S inside the fetcher or should we pass 
everything via SRC_URI parameter to the fetcher?

The fetcher only knows its SRC_URI. This means we have to add the 
patches to the SRC_URI parameters or pass it via additional function 
parameter to the download function.

Please take a look at the following patch to fix a security issue in 
librsvg:
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/commit/aaaa6b68b024b2adbfdf5f8493dfce1f60e5e331

How should the integration into the recipe should look like and how long 
does it take to integrate the changes into the recipe? In case of my OE 
series you could simply apply the patch and mark it as early:

SRC_URI += 
"file://0001-update-url-crate-to-get-an-updated-idna-rustsec-2024.patch;early=1"

We need support for plain patches. Otherwise it is impossible to back 
port patches to fix a security issue or to reuse common tools.

The advantage of the OE based implementation is the possibility to patch 
the lock file. The bitbake based implementation only support a complete 
local lock file to manipulate the dependencies.

Any OE specific solution (.inc or hook) is useless because of the 
complexity of the dependency update. The lock file is a temporary flat 
view onto a dependency tree with inter dependencies, replacements, 
constraints, compatibilities and other meta data. A change without this 
information could lead to anything. It's like the list of git 
repositories of recursive git submodules. It isn't useful to change the 
revision of an arbitrary git repository in the list because the change 
could recursively influence other git submodules.

If that is true we have a huge problem.

By list I mean a list of something like (component, version) pairs

      use a dependency in different versions we need to append the
