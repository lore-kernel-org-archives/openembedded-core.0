Well, all the same I'd like to have that question answered, maybe that's a 
different thread.

Back to Phil's original point though, I tend to think issues with meta-oe 
ought to be solved by fixing meta-oe - if some things in meta-oe are causing so 
much trouble that we have to down-grade the priority of the layer in order to 
squelch them, that's bad.

Cheers,
Paul
