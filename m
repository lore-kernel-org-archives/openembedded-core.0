So I've thought about this more, and I don't think it is a good idea, for two 
reasons:

1) It increases the complexity by a huge amount. New users will have to 
understand how to set the priorities, and if someone reports a problem, we now 
not only need to know what layers they are using, we also need to know what 
mangling of the priorities they might have done. We'd just be introducing more 
potentially untested configurations (as if we don't have enough already.)

2) It just papers over real problems in meta-oe or any other layer you might 
choose to use on top. As I said, if meta-oe has stuff in it that is not 
working, it should be fixed or removed. Let's fix problems instead of finding 
ways of ignoring them.

Cheers,
Paul
