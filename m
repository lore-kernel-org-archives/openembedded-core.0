We should revisit that and fix it as I think it exposes general bugs.

That said, I am thinking we should change the fetcher so all the
submodule urls are included in SRC_URI in future and expanded_urldata()
goes away. We need to update the other backends to match. I have no
knowledge of npm so that one will be hard for me.

Once we do that, your problem becomes easier too I think. It also means
I can then fix various mirror issues I'd like to change.

Yes, although just to be clear, I think bitbake needs to verify that
the dependencies are all listed.

I think that the fetcher is the right place to do this as I would be
very much against poking fetcher internals from OE-Core.

We need to declare and document the stage at which this is expected to
work (i.e. before/after fetch, before/after unpack).

It should probably return structured data including the purl from some
new API.

If the fetcher can conform to our APIs and roughly follow how
rust/crates are working today, I think those would be fine,
particularly if we have good tests too.

It sounds possibly right but I'd defer to Joshua on that one.
