This is almost certainly a result of:

http://git.openembedded.org/bitbake/commit/?id=604df1b25cf114e083f52917df2df64e01279c25

since I didn't believe anyone was using the regexp syntax in the base
url type. The bug I wanted to fix was where if you did:

https://.*/.* file:///some/path/

which seems reasonable enough, it would access:

files:///some/path/

which is clearly not what anyone would want.

I'm not sure what to do about fixing this...

Cheers,

Richard
