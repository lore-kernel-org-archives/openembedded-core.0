I think the point here is that newcomers reading the documentation will use=
 the
default registry and not a custom configuration template, and that it would=
 be
more user-friendly to _not_ make the user choose options from the default
registry.

That being said=E2=80=A6 I think it was the intention of the project to giv=
e the user the
option to choose. I don't really have an opinion on whether the user should
choose or not choose at the moment.

On that note, if we go the "user has to choose every option" way, I think i=
t
would be nice to have a description of built-in fragments too.

If you read this as a newcomer:

  Target machines:
  1. machine/qemux86-64
  2. machine/qemuarm64
  3. machine/qemuriscv64
  4. machine/genericarm64
  5. machine/genericx86-64

  Please select one of the above options by its number:

  Distribution configuration variants:
  1. distro/poky
  2. distro/poky-altcfg
  3. distro/poky-tiny

  Please select one of the above options by its number:

I'm not sure a newcomer would know what to choose here. A description would
probably help. It's also a simple addition I guess?
