Agreed about not forcing the check or updating all .bb/.inc files with
this now, but maybe style guide should be updated now?

I really don't like files with mixed indentation (even when it doesn't
hurt) especially with a lot of files not conforming to style guide now,
using even mix of tabs/spaces on the same line..

FWIW: I've prepared patch for whole meta-smartphone to unify that and
I've sent RFC for few bbclasses in meta-oe too.

Cheers,
