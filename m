The taskids are no more, there is simply no notion of them inside
bitbake any longer. That means that yes, we probably do need to change
the output a bit since the number doesn't mean anything.

Equally, it shouldn't be showing the same thing twice, that is a bug.
Internally to bitbake, everthing is now in the form (or will be when
multiconfig lands) "[multiconfig:<configname>:]<recipe
filename>:<taskname>". The question is whether we expose that to the
user or massage it at all. I'm tempted just to expose that string to
the user.

Sorry about the script changes, not sure we can avoid it though :( The
code is *way* easier to understand, debug and extend after these
changes FWIW so I do believe it very worth doing.

Cheers,

Richard
