This is an interesting corner case. I have this patch lying around which
fixes the issue where a given tag is only available in specific
branches:

http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky-contrib/commit/?h=rpurdie/t2&id=d211662ca92ee084c0c4a3d343e0b1f28ab853ac

however that won't help this case. There is also an issue where the
ls-remote command can match multiple branches/tags since its unanchored:

git ls-remote X foo

refs/heads/foo
refs/heads/broken/foo
refs/tags/foo
refs/tags/broken/foo

All things considered the check is proving useful as its finding some
real issue however we have a few corner cases to iron out...

Cheers,

Richard
