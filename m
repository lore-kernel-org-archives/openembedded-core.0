First this is the wrong list.  The question should have gone to oe-core devel, 
or openembedded-devel lists.  (I have CC'd the first)

Just removing '${PN}-dbg' does not inform the system that you do not want debug 
information to be generated.  There is a set of standard routines, performed 
after do_install, that will generate the debug information unless disabled.

To disable the routines you set:

INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT = '1'
INHIBIT_PACKAGE_STRIP = '1'

There are two settings they can be used separately, but in your case you likely 
want both.

INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT = '1' disables the files in your package from being 
split into run-time and debug components.

INHIBIT_PACKAGE_STRIP = '1' disabled the system from attempting to strip the 
run-time components of debug information.
