State : failure

== Summary ==


Thank you for submitting this patch series to OpenEmbedded Core. This is
an automated response. Several tests have been executed on the proposed
series by patchtest resulting in the following failures:



* Issue             Series sent to the wrong mailing list or some patches from the series correspond to different mailing lists [test_target_mailing_list] 
  Suggested fix    Send the series again to the correct mailing list (ML)
  Suggested ML     poky@yoctoproject.org [http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/]
  Patch's path:    meta-poky/conf/distro/poky.conf

* Issue             Series does not apply on top of target branch [test_series_merge_on_head] 
  Suggested fix    Rebase your series on top of targeted branch
  Targeted branch  master (currently at 65c419b8c4)

* Patch            Added armeb into QEMU_TARGETS.
 Issue             Shortlog does not follow expected format [test_shortlog_format] 
  Suggested fix    Commit shortlog (first line of commit message) should follow the format "<target>: <summary>"



If you believe any of these test results are incorrect, please reply to the
mailing list (openembedded-core@lists.openembedded.org) raising your concerns.
Otherwise we would appreciate you correcting the issues and submitting a new
version of the patchset if applicable. Please ensure you add/increment the
version number when sending the new version (i.e. [PATCH] -> [PATCH v2] ->
[PATCH v3] -> ...).
