It's not an acronym, it's just a name - Hob.

I'll be changing this page and adding more user-centric info in the
coming weeks.

In oe-core (and therefore Poky) we have a wrapper script so from an
oe-init-build-env'd build directory you can just call hob.

The script will create the required configuration files with some
required values.
