You can't compare lock files with automake files. The lock files is 
generated but it contains additional information. The only difference is 
that a program and not a human write the file. If an update creates too 
much noise in the file we should discuss with upstream how to minimize 
it.  The lock file is designed to be under revision control and 
shouldn't change without reason. Dependabot automatically creates 
updates and pull requests for dependency updates. This will not work if 
the lock file isn't deterministic.

I don't use the fetcher because of its drawbacks and limitations. I use 
the same wget URL without the indirection over the package manager 
specific fetchers. I can follow the pypi approach to generate SRC_URIs 
which call a python function:

${@crate_src_uri(d, 'xyz', '1.2.3')}

But why you need this? In any case the manipulation of a dependency 
could lead to interdependence between dependencies.

Add a function to create this file isn't a problem, but I can't ensure 
that this will work in any case and doesn't create problems because of 
the discrepancy between the manifest / lock file and the available sources.

The resolve always create the same URL like the crate fetcher. It only 
changes if you change the resolve function or the crate fetcher. Every 
needed information is defined inside the lock file.

Why you need this finer grained control in the recipe? You have the 
finer grained control in the lock file and additional tools to manage 
the file and all its interdependence. The resolve is deterministic and 
the .inc is only another representation. Manipulation of the 
representation could lead to problems and complicate the process. It's 
like you translate the .am and .in files into a .inc file to influence 
the generated automake files.

Would it help if we have a devtool shell so that you can run "cargo 
update" inside the folder created by "devtool modify" to update 
dependencies via the common tools and create a patch?

The series adds on-the-fly support for package manager specific
dependencies and vendor directories. It contains the following changes:
1. Adds an early fetch, unpack and patch task to unpack and patch source
   code with an embedded lock file for dependencies.
2. Parse the go.sum, Cargo.lock and package-lock.json lock files and
   resolve the dependencies to SRC_URIs.
3. Save the SRC_URIs in a file and adapt all SRC_URIs users to handle
   the SRC_URI files beside the SRC_URIs in the recipe.

    <p>You can't compare lock files with automake files. The lock files
      is generated but it contains additional information. The only
      difference is that a program and not a human write the file. If an
      update creates too much noise in the file we should discuss with
      upstream how to minimize it.&nbsp; The lock file is designed to be
      under revision control and shouldn't change without reason.
      Dependabot automatically creates updates and pull requests for
      dependency updates. This will not work if the lock file isn't
      deterministic.<br>

    <p>Why you need this finer grained control in the recipe? You have
      the finer grained control in the lock file and additional tools to
      manage the file and all its interdependence. The resolve is
      deterministic and the .inc is only another representation.
      Manipulation of the representation could lead to problems and
      complicate the process. It's like you translate the .am and .in
      files into a .inc file to influence the generated automake files.<br>
      <br>
      Would it help if we have a devtool shell so that you can run
      &quot;cargo update&quot; inside the folder created by &quot;devtool modify&quot; to
      update dependencies via the common tools and create a patch?<br>
