I did some replies to the other threads before seeing this, we can feel
free to let those other threads go unanswered, to unify things here.

And of course be expanded into something that is compatible
with our mirroring, but that was implied, I just wanted to say it :)

I still wonder how we'd be able to debug and/or override parts of
the single SRC_URI entry.  Do you consider a lock file or a language
dependency file that could be overwritten from recipe space as
a single SRC_URI entry ? If so, I can get on board with that.

I still prefer the expanded dependencies into some sort of base /
simple fetch format, but a single file that describes all the dependencies
is close enough. As long as there's a way to inspect what the file
was processed into for fetching, then there is some visibility in times
of need.

The remaining question for me is .. how recursive are the dependencies
in the file described on the SRC_URI ? If each line in the single file
is being expanded into multiple different dependencies, then the
visibility into the final list is low, the reproducibility and mirroring of
what
eventually gets fetched need to be guaranteed as well. That of course
isn't different from the issues which could arise with gitsm.

This would be a checksum of the fully expanded dependencies of
the SRC_URI entry ?

Aha. That answers the question that I had above.

Or potentially detect the output of d) being somehow supplied and not
do the dependency resolution ?

I think it is getting closer!

If there's a way to see all of the individual fetches, and change those
fetches,
then it solves most of the issues that I've been using git:// fetches for
in my
go recipes.
