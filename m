Ok, it is good to be clear on that one. I know the fact we hit the network for
tags does concern some but it really is the only way to handle them.

Correct, we are on the same page. This is still quite problematic as the recipes
are meant to parse quickly and a repository clone is definitely not expected.

Even ten recipes using this will show a degradation in parsing speed and I do
get a lot of complaints when parsing slows down for any reason. The user doesn't
expect this and it won't be visible what bitbake is doing (sitting at 99% parsed
for a period).

Also, the "tend to be small" implies someone will create a huge one at some
point even if that is a bad idea for whatever reasons, I just know how these
things end up going :(.

Some further questions:

* Does it only clone a repo in the AUTOREV case?
* Could it only obtain the manifest file somehow without a clone of the repo?

At least for wget or git, it is assumed that for a given url, there would be one
tarball/clone and that there is locking in place to share it between them. This
means you'll see do_fetch tasks for binutils, binutils-cross-XXX, nativesdk-
binutils and binutils-native and one will block the others but the fetch will
happen once and be shared between them. I guess with repo it may not be as
simple as that but we should try and share what we can if possible.

Cheers,

Richard
