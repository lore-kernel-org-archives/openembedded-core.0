Shell tasks should be tabs according to the style guide. Its harder to
check the indentation in those and if the indentation is wrong, it
doesn't matter since they're not whitespace sensitive.

So whilst I'd welcome fixing them up, I don't think they need bitbake
enforcing policy in the same way as python functions.
