Its interesting but my tests are suggesting the reference counting isn't
hurting in at least our common "execute a shell task" use case. With the
way CoW and the data store works, I can believe that.

On the other hand, the serialisation that multiprocessing puts around
its variables looked potentially problematic (and slow) last time I
looked. The manual page specifically says those structures are slow if I
remember rightly.

I agree we need to resolve some of the life cycle issue and remove the
globals. The ones I'm aware of do give significant speed benefits though
and I'm not sure there will be much scope for removing them :/.
