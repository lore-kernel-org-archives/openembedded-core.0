not exactly but if we enable mbox archive download on the ml
you can see the mails in mbox formats and download it. then it would
be git am'able

yes it works fine for most of the times however for oe-core
the patches get sent to ml and then picked and again resent
as pull request sometimes nudged sometimes unmodified and patchwork
does not close them automatically.

so purpose of patchwork in this case would be different then It is just to host
the patches for oe-core but has a different usage for
oe-devel where the patches are picked and closed from the patchwork.
This could be confusing at times especially
for new people. But if we see enough value to keep it
that way then we can think of making some changes so it
detects the resends somehow if the patch hashes are not same
etc and close them.
