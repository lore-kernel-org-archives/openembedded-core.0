FWIW, you can just say "export MALLOC_THRESHOLD=4096" before running
bitbake, which should achieve roughly the same thing with slightly less
typing.

Yeah.  I guess it would be possible to make the pool allocator smarter
to cut down on or ameliorate the fragmentation.  But I don't know
whether that is feasible/straightforward without patching Python itself.
Some further investigation required I suppose.
