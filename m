Could well be this was the reason. I think the exact class the current
code will pick for any intermediary is determined by parse order and I
can't find any case we actually use this property. As you say, I can't
see it being that useful in practise.

I've proposed a bitbake patch which removes the intermediary and
simplifies things a bit.

Cheers,

Richard
