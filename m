Gary, thanks for trying and giving out the input. It is helpful.

For the base image list, HOB generate it by searching all the task whose na=
me containing "image", and we plan to improve it in Yocto 1.2 by searching =
task who inherits image.bbclass. =20

So currently, if you name your own image with XXX-image, HOB should be able=
 to automatically add it in the drop-down list.

And yes, it is helpful to allow user adding item into base image list. it c=
an be done by adding one item in "Edit"->"Preference". I will add this requ=
irement to my plan. For base image filtering, I am not sure if it is necess=
ary, since base image list is not that long. How do you think?

Regards
Ke
