Hello,

this email is a notification from the Auto Upgrade Helper
that the automatic attempt to upgrade the recipe *libtest-warnings-perl* to *0.032* has Succeeded.

Next steps:
    - apply the patch: git am 0001-libtest-warnings-perl-upgrade-0.031-0.032.patch
    - check the changes to upstream patches and summarize them in the commit message,
    - compile an image that contains the package
    - perform some basic sanity tests
    - amend the patch and sign it off: git commit -s --reset-author --amend
    - send it to the appropriate mailing list

Alternatively, if you believe the recipe should not be upgraded at this time,
you can fill RECIPE_NO_UPDATE_REASON in respective recipe file so that
automatic upgrades would no longer be attempted.

Please review the attached files for further information and build/update failures.
Any problem please file a bug at https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Automated%20Update%20Handler

+#  5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this

+# -Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a
+# -larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
+# -advertise this Package as a product of your own.
+# -
+# -6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
+# -from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright
+# -of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
+# -commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
+# -

+# -be considered part of this Package.

+# +Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
+# +Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
+# +you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
+# +commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
+# +distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
+# +product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
+# +an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
+# +form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
+# +interpreter is so embedded.
+# +
+# +6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
+# +output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
+# +under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
+# +them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
+# +Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
+# +Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
+# +binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
+# +neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
+# +fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
+# +not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
+# +Package.
+# +
+# +7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
+# +languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
+# +emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
+# +Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
+# +equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
+# +not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
+# +regression tests for the language.
+# +
+# +8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
+# +permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
+# +when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
+# +to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
+# +construed as a distribution of this Package.

+# +9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
+#  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
