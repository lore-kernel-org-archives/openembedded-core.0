No such discussion has occurred. These are good feature suggestions,
I'm not sure about a plugin mechanism - are you suggesting that
to enable the features mentioned or in addition to?
At least for enabling runtime services there's likely an issue of the
UI having enough knowledge of the init system to do so.
        
I can certainly see at least the three features proposed here being
desirable and I'll probably file those as feature enhancements in the
bugzilla, unless you'd like to?
        
Any further thoughts on customisations to enable via the GUI?
        
Cheers,
Joshua
