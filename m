Thanks for the restate.

The second approach works. The only difference is that a lock file of a 
package manager already resolves the recursive references / inter 
dependencies. In case of gitsm you have to handle the dependencies 
inside the tool and fetch a dependency to resolve it dependencies. In 
both cases a change of a single dependency could influence the other 
dependencies.

The purpose of the lock file is to lock the source of a package to be 
reproducible.

Okay, but please keep in mind that some of my oe patches are reasonable 
independent of the native bitbake fetcher and it is possible to 
integrate the steps from the early class into the fetch task.

The list isn't fix because it depends on the configured package manager 
proxy or registry. We have to remove this feature. But the user could 
use a PREMIRROR to redirect the upstream proxy to its private proxy.

We don't need to trust the tools. We parse the lock file and enrich it 
with fix values. The resolve is deterministic. The output only depends 
on the resolve function, variable values and lock file content.

Can you please elaborate this point. We already check the integrity of 
the lock file and we have deterministically resolve the SRC_URIs.

Why is this needed? The generated SRC_URIs could be resolved via 
fetcher.expanded_urldata().

I'm afraid this will be complicated since PATCH is applied in S and not 
in UNPACKDIR.

The advantage is that the SRC_URI still contains the dependencies if you 
expand the urldata. On the other side the integration of the patches in 
the fetcher sounds complicated.

      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">We have two fundamentally different approaches:

a) a single entry in SRC_URI with magic behind the scenes expanding
this into a list of dependencies

b) multiple entries in SRC_URI generated with tooling

gitsm is similar to a), partly because it can contain recursive
references to other submodules so the second approach wouldn't work.
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    The second approach works. The only difference is that a lock file
    of a package manager already resolves the recursive references /
    inter dependencies. In case of gitsm you have to handle the
    dependencies inside the tool and fetch a dependency to resolve it
    dependencies. In both cases a change of a single dependency could
    influence the other dependencies.<br>

      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">crates are handled with the b) approach today.

Developers in general are more comfortable with b) since they can more
easily see what is going on but it is also the harder one since it
deviates most from the underlying tools and has two sets of data that
require to be in sync.

Some feel the .inc files enabling b) are effectively machine generated
and could be removed with the work happening transparently instead,
simplifying the recipes and commits. This allows easier use of the
underlying tooling too.

I think firstly, we need to document some key principles. Behind the
scenes, any given url should expand to a defined list of components and
that list has to be deterministic and not &quot;floating&quot;, i.e. always the
same regardless of changes in any registry or other upstream. If there
are changes, they need to be detected and there needs to be a hard
error. Also, if the code sees things declared in a way they could vary,
that also needs to be a hard error.</pre>

    The purpose of the lock file is to lock the source of a package to
    be reproducible.<br>

Most of the concerns I've seen are about how easy it is to understand
what is going on behind the scenes. The move of code to OE and
splitting everything into multiple tasks/stages does do that to some
extent but it does it in a way which I think is going to create a new
and different set of problems.

    </blockquote>
    Okay, but please keep in mind that some of my oe patches are
    reasonable independent of the native bitbake fetcher and it is
    possible to integrate the steps from the early class into the fetch
    task.<br>

      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">I'm therefore wondering if there is a different way. The changes I'm
wondering about would be to:

a) embrace the single SRC_URI entry

b) require a checksum of the internal &quot;URL list&quot; that is included
in&nbsp;SRC_URI, much in the same way that we have checksums of tarballs.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    The list isn't fix because it depends on the configured package
    manager proxy or registry. We have to remove this feature. But the
    user could use a PREMIRROR to redirect the upstream proxy to its
    private proxy.<br>

    <p>We don't need to trust the tools. We parse the lock file and
      enrich it with fix values. The resolve is deterministic. The

      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">f) create new tools that allow the fetcher to be stepped through and
for example partially run, or run with clear debug output showing what

standalone tools, maybe a devtool module, I don't know. We may want to
make the fetch/unpack logs more useful in general as right now you
don't get much useful data about what it is doing.


If we do those things, where does that get us? How much buy in do our
different stakeholders have?

FWIW I am leaning towards having this code in the bitbake fetcher as a
first class citizen as to do otherwise is going to create layers of
abstraction and we probably have enough of those already.

    <p>The advantage is that the SRC_URI still contains the dependencies
      <span style="white-space: pre-wrap">if you expand the urldata. On the other side the integration of the patches in the fetcher sounds complicated.
