What we're trying to do is move everything to use a standard mechanism
for reporting issues of this type. With insane.bbclass, you can elect
whether a given type of error is a warning or errors and fails the task.

There are however several places where bb.error is used without that
mechanism. I'd love to see them fixed, please file a bug for it...

Agreed, please open a bug for it.

FWIW Bitbake will set a non-zero exit code if any error messages appear,
as the message says. Whilst people find that confusing, I continue to
believe it is the right thing to be doing and we need to tighten up
things in other places as I describe above. That error code does help us
catch problems on the autobuilders and so forth.

Cheers,

Richard
