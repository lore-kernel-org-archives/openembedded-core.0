Hmm, yes, good point. Perhaps it was to allow the user to override an
intermediate function that might or might not exist?

E.g. in the do_configure calls gnomebase_do_configure calls
autotools_do_configure case, the user could override
gnomebase_do_configure, without having to know whether or not gnomebase
actually defines a configure function?

I'm guessing here, but that *could* be why it was implemented this way. In
practice, however, we have to know what our classes are doing anyway, most
of the time, for a wide variety of reasons. E.g. uses of overrides have to
be operated against carefully to avoid your changes being blown away.
