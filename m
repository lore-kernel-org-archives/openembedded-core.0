I could try and reply to all your points but this one jumps out as a
really fundamental thing we disagree on. All our existing code assumes
that:

"All sources are downloaded during do_fetch"

which means once do_fetch runs, we have all the sources. That is quite
different to what you say above. I fully appreciate it imposes quite
some constraints but it doesn't change the fact that this is the
situation.

Which is why I'm saying that I'd prefer to do this in bitbake and if we
have to drop that patching as a result, so be it.

We have a patchwork where people trust the current boundaries between
the different pieces. You want to change the boundaries, and the
assumptions made about those boundaries and replace it with something
that isn't going to be easily understood by most of the userbase as the
concepts are complex and break the existing models people work with.
I'm doing my best to explain the problem but either I'm failing at that
or we simply disagree on them.

People are too focused in their own problems to be able to spend enough
time on these architectural type pieces. We do badly need this kind of
work which is why I'm trying to help this move forward but equally we
have to do it in a way which doesn't destablise our existing userbase,
in other words we may have to make some compromises. I'd like to hope
we pick the right ones. I'm worried as we have tried solutions for this
space before and the fact we're discussing them again shows we haven't
got it right yet.

Cheers,

Richard
