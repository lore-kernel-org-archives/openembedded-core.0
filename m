We do use local.conf in that if values are set there and not in either
of the hob configuration files the values from local.conf are used
however I had an explicit feature request to not modify local.conf.

I actually started looking at having Hob use an independent
configuration file so that Hob settings would persist across build
directories, this didn't make it in the 1.1 time frame unfortunately.
