Hmm, that's quite interesting, thanks for that tidbit. We should
consider looking into that. On a related note, I think we should sit
down and basically review every use of a cache anywhere in bitbake and
rethink their operation. We still have multiple caches stored as
globals with no expiration policy of any sort, they accrue
indefinitely, until process exit. As we review them, we could consider
this as well on a case-by-case basis.
