I also agree with this, which is why I've been suggesting the "drop-in"
lock files. That's a fetch and copy and not a patching.  I ended up
doing a custom patch step for some of the kernel meta data and to
this day it is still on my list to change (and I'll be doing that shortly).

FWIW. This is the mental model that I've always worked with
during my reviews of the series.

I think I'm following this part correctly. When we say "crate the desired
way to go", I read that as "one dependency fetch by the language
specific 'protocol' (crate:// in this example)".  If so, then I also agree.

It became clear very quickly that packaging go dependencies as
separate recipes wasn't going to work, which I assume is the pypi
reference (that works for languages with "stricter" package release
processes).

Which is how we ended up with the create:// lines in the .inc files
and also how I ended up with all my git:// fetches in my bigger
golang recipes. That we could loop, recurse, do whatever we needed
to fully resolve the dependencies, but when the actual fetch and
build of the recipe happened, that has all been detangled and is
a simple iterative processing of the lines.

For me, that separates my debugging into distinct phases. At one
point I'm scratching my head and looking at the language dependency
files, and fixing any issues there. Later on, if there are any issues my
problems are with mirrors, downloading, etc.

I'd also add a last stage of "getting the files in the position that
the language needs for vendoring". I then debug that as a separate
thing.

I'm definitely ok with this as well, as long as it is complete and is
fully expanded, we don't need the SRC_URIs explicitly expanded in
the recipes. I may still prefer the fully expanded SRC_URIs, but I
also see a route to add that later in my own recipes as needed.

Avoiding both some bikeshedding and feature creep! :)

Richard: Which ones would you say don't need to be in something initial ?

To me, I'd say the "multiple package manager files" or the "no manual
bitbake call after"  and "support for patching the lockfile".

As for where something belongs vs another, let's just say I have
no experience to distrust Richard's experience in these areas. I've
only rarely had to delve deep enough to even know some of the
pitfalls. But I do strongly agree that we need to keep the phases
separate with some sort of clear handoff (via files, but not necessarily
files in recipes) between them.

Bruce

&gt; &gt; &gt; class or the SRC_URI direct and doesn&#39;t expect recursive=
 implicit<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; URIs of gitsm. In reality the SRC_URI describe the given URI=
s only<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and doesn&#39;t contain the additional implicit URIs. The ta=
sk flow<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; applies patches after the unpack and prevent patches to the =
gitsm. In<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reality a patch could influence the implicit URIs and isn&#3=
9;t<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; independent.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would recommend to keep the patching outside of bitbake an=
d instead<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handle the implicit URIs inside oe-core. We could write the =
implicit<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; URIs into files in the work directory and migrate the scatte=
red<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; direct users of the SRC_URI / Fetch class to a common oe-cor=
e<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; function. This functions returns the given URIs and optional=
 any<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; additional implicit URIs. This allows the usage of the task<=
br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dependencies to ensure that the implicit URIs are resolved b=
efore<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; use.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The package manager lock file needs a single unpack and patc=
h step<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whereas the gitsm needs a recursive unpack and patch of ever=
y<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; successive gitsm. This makes it impossible to use additional=
 tasks.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We could add the resolve of the implicit URIs to the fetch t=
ask to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; support recursive resolve (gitsm).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. download SRC_URIs<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. exit if no URI is marked as unresolved<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. unpack unresolved URIs<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. apply associated patches<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. resolve URIs<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. goto 2 <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This will eliminate the need for the partial implicit URI an=
d gitsm<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; support in bitbake and makes the fetcher code simpler. The p=
atching<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could remain in oe-core and patches could be applied to gits=
m and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; package manager lock files. Additionally we remove code dupl=
ication<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and simplify future changes to the SRC_URI determination.<br=
>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It will add an indirection for the SRC_URI but the current c=
ode<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; already shows that this makes problems. Only the archiver cl=
ass uses<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the expanded_urldata function and all other classes includin=
g the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spdx class ignore the implicit SRC_URIs.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit worried we&#39;re getting caught up by the terminol=
ogy. We don&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; necessarily have to &quot;patch&quot; the component list so much =
as allow<br>
&gt; &gt; something like a function to hook and adjust things. That then re=
moves<br>
&gt; &gt; the need for it to be a specific task.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0We can use a common patch without a do_patch task. We could even=
<br>
&gt; call the patch code from the do_patch without an extra task. I<br>
&gt; propose to call the code from the do_patch task in the do_fetch task.<=
br>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t matter if we use a hook or task. We should minimize the=
<br>
&gt; work for the user. The common solution to manipulate a package<br>
&gt; manager lock file is a patch file and we have the code to handle<br>
&gt; patch files.<br>
<br>
One of the challenges is the &quot;patch&quot; code/module lives in OE-Core=
. That<br>
means the fetcher can&#39;t call into it.<br>
<br>
I appreciate this means you&#39;ll argue the fetcher code should move to<br=

OE, or the vendor code should be in OE, however I am pretty decided<br>
that is a really bad idea. Whether I can convey why, I don&#39;t know but I=
<br>
have tried.<br>
<br>
I also very strongly want to maintain our separation of do_fetch,<br>

That tracer code was added after a lot of discussion that took up a ton<br>

I&#39;d<br>
&gt; &gt; rather improve usability at the cost of the inclusion of gitsm, w=
hich<br>
&gt; &gt; is the most functional fetcher we currently have in this group.<b=
r>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I include gitsm because it is similar to the package manager and have<=

&gt; some drawbacks which I solve with my approach. It is the only fetcher<=

I believe there was a way added to solve the drawback you mention. The<br>

about much more radical re-designs.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; I will repeat again that I do strongly feel that a strong API in<=
br>
&gt; &gt; bitbake is going to lead to an overall better design that somethi=
ng<br>
&gt; &gt; bolted onto the fetcher in OE-Core.<br>
<br>
The &quot;fetcher&quot; is an API exposed by Bitbake with the intent of<br>
standardising the fetching of source code. It&#39;s aim is to support<br>
objectives such as allowing resilience through source mirrors and<br>
support build reproducibility. There is a document in bitbake which<br>
tries to at least summarise some of that after it was requested it be<br>
written down.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div><div class=3D"gmail_defau=

<br>
&gt; What is a fetcher? We have fetchers for protocols (wget, git),<br>
<br>
These were the original fetchers using the original APIs.<br>
<br>
&gt; wrapper around other fetchers (crate, gomod and gomodgit)<br>
<br>
These are newer and some work better than others are people have<br>
attempted to git the newer languages into the older framework.<br>
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 and wrapper around other fetchers which embedded file parser (gi=
tsm,<br>
&gt; npmsw).<br>
<br>
Of these, gitsm is now relatively successfully integrated and<br>
functional.<br>
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 Thereby the gitsm fetcher fetch a source and parse the embedded<=
br>
&gt; file. The npmsw fetcher parse a file from the meta layer. The gitsm<br=

&gt; fetcher recursive combines the download and unpack function call in<br=

&gt; mostly every class function.<br>
<br>
Sadly there did not seem to be any other way to handle that. I&#39;d<br>
imagine that some of the other fetchers are going to have to work<br>
similarly, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; The wrappers has the disadvantage that they use uncommon URIs which<br=

&gt; are useless for the SBOM. We support PyPI without the need for an<br>

<br>
We support pypi in so much as we have a recipe per dependency. That was<br>
not deemed possible for npm or crates. I would disagree that uncommon<br>
URIS are useless for SBOMs. They can be problematic but having the data<br>
there means it is at least listed. There are also ways they can be<br>
extended (e.g. the intercept code I link to above).<br>
<br>
&gt; Is PyPI or crate the desired way to go?<br>

actually say yes.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div><div class=3D"gmail_d=

The challenge is that once you process it, you need to fetch more<br>
