if you install it right then you should get one rpm with library another
one ${PN}-dev which should contain the headers and all debug info will
be split out into a rpm of its own ${PN}-dbg, this is standard
packaging strategy in OE.

Yes it will, is there any issue with that ?

overriding PACKAGES will leave some unpackaged files.

I would suggest to use standard packaging split if thats not a big
issue.
