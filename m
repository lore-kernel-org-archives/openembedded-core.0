Thank you for submitting this patch series to OpenEmbedded Core. This is
an automated response. Several tests have been executed on the proposed
series by patchtest resulting in the following failures:



* Issue             Series does not apply on top of target branch [test_series_merge_on_head]

  Targeted branch  master (currently at cdbd47dd7e)



If you believe any of these test results are incorrect, please reply to the

Otherwise we would appreciate you correcting the issues and submitting a new
version of the patchset if applicable. Please ensure you add/increment the

[PATCH v3] -> ...).
