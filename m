For reference, only VSS increases and RSS does not in this case so it
looks like there are leftover memory mappings.

Digging a little deeper, it was mainly strings that we were making the
saving with. I checked and the allocator for string objects in python
will return them to the main python objector allocator, maintaining only
a small queue of 80 objects for reuse. For objects over 256 bytes in
size, the glibc malloc/free calls are used. In turn, glibc uses sbrk()
to change the data segment size if necessary for anything less that
128kb in size. The string in the caches in question are very likely to
be over 256 bytes in size but under 128kb.

The problem is then going to be memory fragmentation since whilst we can
free the memory used by the objects, its extremely unlikely everything
to the end of the data segment is likely to be free so sbrk() cannot be
rolled backwards to free memory.

So in summary its unlikely we're going to get freed memory back with
python for these kinds of caches, at least from the main server
process...

Cheers,
