Yes; I had problem using GIT with PR server last time I tried it.

Good that it's being worked on/has been fixed.

I like to idea of a single updating place. What I dislike is AUTOINC
not being taken care in the fetcher.

In this case any GIT revision changes, the AUTOINC won't bump as usual
(without PR server)?
