I know you've sent me link do different style guide last time I've
asked, but first google hit (for openembedded style guide):
http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Styleguide

says about tabs only this:
- Use spaces for indentation as developers tends to use different amount
  of spaces per one tab.

So only in yocto wiki there are 2 more bullets after that
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Recipe_%26_Patch_Style_Guide
- Use spaces for indentation as developers tends to use different amount
  of spaces per one tab.
- Shell functions should use tabs
- Python functions should use spaces (4 spaces per indent).

And yocto style guide is not in first 5 pages of result when searching
for "openembedded style guide".
