Well in this I agree with khem that it would be more consistent to use
priority from bblayers.conf. You're right that changing priority of an
entire layer is having too big impact, but whoever is writing his
bblayers.conf has better information about what he needs/wants from
particular layer then layer maintainer who has no clue in which layer
stack his layer will end up.

And with priority in bblayers.conf I can say how much I trust him.
