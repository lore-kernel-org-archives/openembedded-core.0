I'm afraid this assumption is not correct. There are two distinct
namespaces we have, the "buildtime" recipe names (PN) and the runtime
package names. PREFERRED_PROVIDER takes recipe names (PN), not runtime
ones. Mixing the two up is going to cause confusion and problems so the
patch as it stands cannot be merged for this reason.

We have several issues with the way PREFERRED_PROVIDER works today and
the translations between build time and runtime. I suspect that code
needs rethinking to some extent. I know 5044 is assined to me, as yet
I've not been able to find the time it needs to properly think through
the different issues and fix it :(
