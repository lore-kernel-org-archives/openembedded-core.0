I'm a bit worried we're getting caught up by the terminology. We don't
necessarily have to "patch" the component list so much as allow
something like a function to hook and adjust things. That then removes
the need for it to be a specific task.

I'm also not sure that drawing gitsm into this is a great idea when it
is effectively already working  quite well. I appreciate the desire to
have neat abstractions applying accross everything equally but I'm not
sure we can achieve that with the level of usability we need and I'd
rather improve usability at the cost of the inclusion of gitsm, which
is the most functional fetcher we currently have in this group.

I will repeat again that I do strongly feel that a strong API in
bitbake is going to lead to an overall better design that something
bolted onto the fetcher in OE-Core.

Cheers,

Richard
