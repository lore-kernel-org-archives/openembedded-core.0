I may be using different terminology, but I do know what the lock files are
(I interchange the dependency and lock files at times though), patching
*anything* that is generated is a bad idea, that's my point (so the
comparison is valid).

Can you elaborate on the limitations ?

 Although from your description, I'm fine calling wget a "fetcher". I'm
just talking about something that pulls in the dependency source code,
whether it be git, wget, or some other protocol, it's the concept that is
the same.

Because I need to redirect and update them manually. Anything that runs in
python to determine the fetch is also hard to debug, since I'd be
interested in the output of that processing if there's an issue.

I'm describing something like (and I'm describing it badly .. but I'll try
anyway:

 <language file that describes the dependencies>
 <process that file into a specific source  revision and fetch/download
location>
 <have a language / protocol specific fetcher get the modules / source code
iteratively from a list of expanded dependencies>
 <put them into place for the build>
 <arrange for the build to use those fetched depdendencies>

wget would fall into that "language specific fetcher", as would git or "go
vendor" (Although I don't really like that, since it isn't transparent
where the source code is being pulled from).  Copying the files into
vendor, or again "go mod vendor" (doing both the fetch and placement) would
be the "put them in place for the build".

I realize that is what your series is doing.

The processing, fetching, placement  stages could run fully behind the
scenes from a dependency/lock file, or be skipped if broken out into the
list of fetches (from the SCR_URI (via .inc file or whatever)). Those are
the two modes I'm describing, where the "processing the file into a
specific source revision / fetch steps" can be avoided.

Right, and that is fine. If someone bumps a revision to the point where the
dependency now has different dependencies that are not in the lock file,
then they've taken things fully into their control and need to deal with
any issues.  That obviously isn't the default, but does allow an advanced
user/developer the possibility to have fine grained control and debug.

That's good, and if the lock file is present (versus just a dependency
file), would the processing and creation of the lock file be skipped ?

The tools that I'm talking about are a text editor, not anything language
specific.  I don't want or need tools to manipulate those files, I want to
see the base fetches of the dependencies, it is those that I'm manipulating=
.

I'm simply describing what I've done in the past to fix issues with the
builds and pull in fixes, so yes, it is something that I need.

Maybe, but I don't use devtool at all for my recipe maintenance, and I
would push back against it being a requirement to do so.

The series adds on-the-fly support for package manager specific
dependencies and vendor directories. It contains the following changes:
1. Adds an early fetch, unpack and patch task to unpack and patch source
   code with an embedded lock file for dependencies.
2. Parse the go.sum, Cargo.lock and package-lock.json lock files and
   resolve the dependencies to SRC_URIs.
3. Save the SRC_URIs in a file and adapt all SRC_URIs users to handle
   the SRC_URI files beside the SRC_URIs in the recipe.
